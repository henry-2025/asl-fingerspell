# Google ASL Fingerspell Kaggle Challenge: Pose estimates $\to$ text seq2seq model

This was my submission to Google's ASL Fingerspell Challenge and probably my first real deep learning project beyond the Hello World neural nets they have you build on the Pytorch intro page. It's not much and I still clearly have a long way to go before I can call myself a qualified ML engineer. That said, I am proud of my work here and I don't think there have been many other times where I have learned this much in such a small amonut of time.

The main tasks in this project were as follows:

1. [Processing and loading a ~200G tabular dataset efficiently](#dataset-processing-and-loading)
2. Setting up cloud training and file storage infrastructure
3. Designing and training a seq2seq model that converts vector time-series data into 
4. Creating a model deployment that was compliant with the competition evaluation standards
5. Model iteration

I go into summary detail on each of these sections, documenting my methods and recounting challenges that I encountered during the engineering and design processes.

## Dataset processing and loading

While model training and architecture was a big focus of my work on this project, a surprising amount of work went into learning the tools and techniques required data loading pipelines. Since this was my first real deep learning project beyond the "Hello World" neural nets that you build in the Pytorch intro page, Most of my  for large datasets.

It is also my first real deep learning project, which I think it
