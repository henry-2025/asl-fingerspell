# Google ASL Fingerspell Kaggle Challenge: Pose estimates $\to$ text seq2seq model

This was my submission to Google's ASL Fingerspell Challenge and probably my first real deep learning project.

The repository still needs big-time cleanup and I need to put the notebooks in python files/have a conda environment to run locally. Check out the article on my website for more of an in-depth writeup: https://www.jhpick.com/projects/asl-fingerspell.
